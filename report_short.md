Short Report â€” Accurate Pest Detection
Objective: Automatic early-warning for probable pest-related canopy stress using Sentinel-2 NDVI anomalies.
Method: Multi-year baseline median NDVI, recent NDVI, require consecutive drops and area-fraction threshold for detection.
Tools: Google Earth Engine (COPERNICUS/S2_SR), Streamlit (local UI).
Limitations: Proxy detection; ground validation recommended.
